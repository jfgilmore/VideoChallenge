1. Build a simple react native app to record and upload videos on firebase.
(App should be compatible with the latest Xcode and Android versions).
Feel free to use any third party library to complete this task.
App should support both iOS and android.

2. Download the latest video and show it in the app
(latest video, means the last uploaded video)
Would be great to have:
- Compression of HD Videos into 480p, before uploading
- Batch downloading
- Caching

Once you have completed these app(s) please provide us with the source
code as well as deployable builds (zip file) and email to:
